## About Me

Hi! My name is Eduardo but most people just call me Ed. I'm a huge gamer and general tech enthusiast. I tend to bounce around different interests every two weeks or so and I enjoy trying out new things. 

I mainly started this blog to write about my personal interests and have it be a place I can use to document my side projects. A lot of this will probably change within the coming months or so as I refine my "blogging skils".
