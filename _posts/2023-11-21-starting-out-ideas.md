## What To Do With This Site

This post is mainly for me to

1. Get used to using Jekyll
2. Outline what to do with this blog

This post will mostly be about creating sensible (to me anyway) categories and tags.

Jekyll looks like it's written in Ruby so I might get around to tweaking the source code of this theme to get it to do whatever it already doesn't do. But that will probably come a little later.

## Things to Write About

Here are some things I've thought about writing about. As mentioned in my first post, this will probably primarily be a tech blog, with other topics sprinkled in.

But there are some "series" that I think I want to start...

### Reviews

I want to separate these into two different categories because sometimes things seem great upon first trying them out but then the ugly parts start showing up later, and the opposite is true as well.

* First Impression Reviews
* Long Term Use Reviews

### Tutorials

These will probably be the ones I spend the most quality assurance time on and will post less frequently. I've wanted to write tutorials before but I've always felt that the topics I want to write about either already have good tutorials or I don't consider myself good enough at them to write about them (blind leading the blind kind of feeling).

### Educated Opinions and Room Temperature IQ Thoughts

I want to be able to write about opinions that I have that I can support strong arguments and evidence, and also write about hills I am willing to die on. These posts will definitely be marked as opinions, and should probably not be taken too seriously.

### Research

I enjoyed doing statistics and data visualization while I was at University. I remember having to find some trends in [Yelp's Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) as part of my Big Data course.

It will probably take me some time to write anything half-decent and I'm pretty sure my first few posts will be garbage, but you can't be good at something without being dogwater at it first.

### Misc

This is going to be the famous junk drawer everyone has in their house but for blog content. I'm almost positive that I'll have the itch to write about something but will waste too much time thinking about where to shove it, so to the misc category it goes.
